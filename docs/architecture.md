# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the enterprise Azure infrastructure architecture deployed using Terraform, following the Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Networking Layer

The foundation of our infrastructure, providing secure and isolated network environments.

**Components:**

- NAT Gateway for outbound internet access
- Private Endpoints for PaaS services
- VNet Peering for cross-region connectivity

**Design Decisions:**
- Hub-and-spoke topology for centralized security
- /16 CIDR blocks per VNet for future growth
- Separate subnets for each tier (web, app, data)

### 2. Security Layer

Implements defense-in-depth security strategy.

**Components:**
- Azure Key Vault for secrets and certificate management

- Encryption at rest and in transit

### 5. Storage Layer

Durable and scalable storage solutions.

**Components:**

**Design Decisions:**
- ZRS or GZRS for production storage
- Private endpoints for storage accounts
- Immutable blob storage for audit logs
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- Soft delete enabled (7-14 days retention)

### 6. DNS Layer

Name resolution for internal and external resources.

**Components:**
- Azure DNS zones for public DNS
- Private DNS zones for internal resolution
- DNS records for services and endpoints

**Design Decisions:**
- Split-brain DNS for internal/external resolution
- Automated DNS record management via Terraform
- TTL optimization for performance

### 7. Monitoring Layer

Comprehensive observability and alerting.

**Components:**
- Log Analytics Workspace for centralized logging
- Application Insights for APM
- Azure Monitor for metrics and alerts
- Action Groups for alert notifications
- Diagnostic settings on all resources

**Design Decisions:**
- 30-90 day log retention based on compliance
- Custom metrics for business KPIs
- Multi-level alerting (info, warning, critical)
- Integration with incident management systems

## Network Architecture

### Hub-and-Spoke Topology

```
        ┌─────────────────────────┐
        │   Hub VNet (Shared)     │
        │  - Azure Firewall       │
        │  - VPN Gateway          │
        │  - Bastion Host         │
        └──────────┬──────────────┘
                   │
        ┌──────────┼──────────┐
        │          │          │
   ┌────▼───┐ ┌───▼────┐ ┌───▼────┐

   │  Dev   │ │  QA    │ │  Prod  │
   │  VNet  │ │  VNet  │ │  VNet  │
   └────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘
```

### Subnet Design

Each spoke VNet contains:
- Gateway Subnet (for VPN/ExpressRoute)
- AzureBastionSubnet
- Management Subnet (jump boxes, agents)
- Web Tier Subnet (Application Gateway, Load Balancers)
- Application Tier Subnet (App Services, VMs, AKS)
- Data Tier Subnet (Databases with private endpoints)
- Private Endpoint Subnet
- AKS System Node Pool Subnet
- AKS User Node Pool Subnet

## High Availability Design

### Availability Zones

Production resources deployed across multiple availability zones:
- Zone-redundant VMs and VMSS
- Zone-redundant databases
- Zone-redundant storage (ZRS/GZRS)
- AKS node pools across zones

### Disaster Recovery

- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: < 1 hour
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: < 4 hours
- Automated backups to geo-redundant storage
- Cross-region replication for critical data
- Documented failover procedures
