# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the enterprise Azure infrastructure architecture deployed using Terraform, following the Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Networking Layer

The foundation of our infrastructure, providing secure and isolated network environments.

**Components:**
- Virtual Networks (VNets) with CIDR planning
- Subnets with service delegation
- Network Security Groups (NSGs) with deny-by-default rules
- Application Gateway for web application firewall
- Azure Load Balancer for internal load balancing
- NAT Gateway for outbound internet access
- Private Endpoints for PaaS services
- VNet Peering for cross-region connectivity

**Design Decisions:**
- Hub-and-spoke topology for centralized security
- /16 CIDR blocks per VNet for future growth
- Separate subnets for each tier (web, app, data)
- NSG flow logs enabled for security analysis

### 2. Security Layer

Implements defense-in-depth security strategy.

**Components:**
- Azure Key Vault for secrets and certificate management
- Managed Identities for passwordless authentication
- Private DNS Zones for private endpoint resolution
- Azure Policy for governance
- Azure Firewall for network filtering
- DDoS Protection Standard

**Design Decisions:**
- Soft delete enabled on Key Vault (90-day retention)
- RBAC for Key Vault access policies
- Customer-managed encryption keys where applicable
- Private endpoints for all PaaS services

### 3. Compute Layer

Provides scalable compute resources for applications.

**Components:**
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for containerized workloads
- Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) for stateless applications
- Azure App Service for PaaS web applications
- Azure Functions for serverless compute
- Container Instances for short-lived tasks

**Design Decisions:**
- AKS with Azure CNI for advanced networking
- Availability zones for high availability
- Auto-scaling based on metrics
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads

### 4. Database Layer

Managed database services for various data persistence needs.

**Components:**
- Azure SQL Database with elastic pools
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
- Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server
- Azure Cosmos DB for globally distributed data
- Azure Redis Cache for session state and caching

**Design Decisions:**
- Zone-redundant databases for production
- Automated backups with point-in-time restore
- Private endpoints for all database connections
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### 5. Storage Layer

Durable and scalable storage solutions.

**Components:**
- Azure Storage Accounts (Standard and Premium)
- Blob Storage with lifecycle management
- Azure Files for SMB shares
- Managed Disks for VMs

**Design Decisions:**
- ZRS or GZRS for production storage
- Private endpoints for storage accounts
- Immutable blob storage for audit logs
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- Soft delete enabled (7-14 days retention)

### 6. DNS Layer

Name resolution for internal and external resources.

**Components:**
- Azure DNS zones for public DNS
- Private DNS zones for internal resolution
- DNS records for services and endpoints

**Design Decisions:**
- Split-brain DNS for internal/external resolution
